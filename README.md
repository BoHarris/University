Developed a comprehensive Java-based University Management System, structured with a focus on modularity, encapsulation, and scalability. This project includes well-defined layers, each handling specific responsibilities to maintain clean architecture and ease of maintenance.

DAO Layer: Manages data access operations, optimizing interactions with database entities.
Service Layer: Contains numerous services to handle specific business logic related to key entities (e.g., UserService, CourseService, AddressService), following the principles of SOLID design.
Model Layer: Encapsulates core university models, including structures like Address, City, and Country to represent the institution's spatial data accurately.
Enums: Defined enums like CREDENTIALS, DEPARTMENT, and POSITION to ensure consistent handling of role-based operations across the application.
Resources: XML and JSON resources support structured data, assisting with configuration, initial data loading, and facilitating testing.
Testing: Integrated a testNG structure to validate functionality, ensuring high reliability and robustness.
Overall, this project showcases a deep understanding of layered architecture, object-oriented programming principles, and industry-standard practices in application structure, making it an effective solution for university management.
